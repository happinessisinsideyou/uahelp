# Motivation:
right this second, when you are reading these lines, terrible events are taking place in Ukraine - Putin (хуйло) gave a criminal command to his troops to attack Ukraine and seize power in his dirty hands! There is a destruction of cities by russian troops and the killing of innocent people - citizens of Ukraine!

We want to give every person in the world the opportunity to contribute to the bright and happy future of our big and beautiful world - to support the Ukrainian Army with donations.
After all, it is the outcome of today's war in Ukraine that will determine what our World will be like tomorrow - free, democratic and progressive, or totalitarian and degrading.

You can influence this right now - support the Ukrainian Army in the fight against evil.

We have created a simple snippet for Google Tag Manager, which will allow you to place a notification on your site for your users in a few clicks, which allows your site's visitors to make donations for the Ukrainian Army in a very simple way.
